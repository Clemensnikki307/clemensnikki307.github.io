<!-- 
I had multiple issues with getting this multiple choice quiz to function properly. 
In the previous chapter I had it set up to where there are 3 right answers and if	
you were to choose any of them it would give you the "You're right" text. I wanted to 
change it so that it would only give you that when you have choosen all three correct answers.
I had to find a way to identify the "right" answers and then have the program only do the "You're right"
text once all three were choosen and not any less. I mainly utilized the w3c validator for my HTML as 
Well as the console for any errors that happened when executing the code.
